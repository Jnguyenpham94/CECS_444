The LL(1) Parser
We will be making a LL(1) parser in this course. Aside from the scanner/lexer that you have created, you will use the grammar specification in grammar.txt to match tokens that your scanner will output.

The grammar will not be enough, however, to fully complete your parser. In addition to the included files, you will need to produce a parse table which takes the grammar and matches statements from your input. Recall our lectures: in order to create the parse table, you will need:
a left-recursion free grammar (Good news! It's already left-recursion free! You can thank me later.)
the first sets
the follow sets
the predict sets
Due by Dec 10:

Your completed parser, which will include:

the parse table
the sets (first, follow, predict)
the parser interpreter runtime file
and a test run screenshot which shows the successful completion of hardtestcase.txt
Like the requirements for the scanner, your parser will be graded on how accurate it handles the requirements given in grammar.txt

If you complete all of this, give yourself a strong pat on the back. You've just accomplished one of the most difficult tasks in computer science!
